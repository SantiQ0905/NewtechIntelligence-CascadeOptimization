# DEVPOST HACKMTY: Cascade Optimizer

## GENERAL INFORMATION
- **Project Name:** 
    - CASCADE OPTMIZER

- **Elevator Pitch:** 
    - Cascade Optimizer modernizes Cascade workflows by integrating Agile methods and AI-powered tracking for productivity. It generates insightful reports with actionable tips to boost team efficiency.

## PROJECT DETAILS
- **About the project:** 
    - Inspiration:
        - Cascade Optimizer was created to address the inefficiencies that traditional Cascade workflows face when trying to adapt to more modern and dynamic project management methods. With the increasing adoption of Agile, Scrum, and Sprints, companies need a solution that allows them to maintain the structured approach of Cascade while embracing the flexibility and speed of newer methodologies. Cascade Optimizer bridges this gap by providing seamless integration that enhances workflow management and boosts productivity.

    - What it does
        - Cascade Optimizer is a revolutionary software solution designed to enhance the efficiency of project management workflows. It generates detailed reports based on productivity scores calculated from continuous work hours logged per task over multiple days. This enables project managers to maintain a clear overview of progress, allocate resources effectively, and ensure deadlines are met. The software integrates with various modern project management methods, allowing companies to keep their Cascade structure while gaining the benefits of Agile practices.

    - How we built it
        - The core of Cascade Optimizer's functionality lies in its advanced use of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robust backend technologies. The platform leverages the Django framework to provide a secure, scalable, and high-performance backend infrastructure. Django's built-in features, such as the admin panel, facilitate efficient data management, making it easier to handle complex data models for tasks and productivity tracking. A specially trained OpenVino model, utilizing YOLO for object detection, tracks and monitors employees' activity at their desks, calculating the actual work hours linked to specific tasks. The processed data is managed throug our backend to generate comprehensive PDF reports enriched with AI-driven recommendations and productivity tips for each employee.

    - Challenges we ran into
        -  Developing a system that accurately tracks productivity using AI without invading privacy was a significant challenge. Ensuring seamless integration between various frameworks and APIs while maintaining performance and scalability required extensive testing and optimization.

    - Accomplishments that we're proud of
        - We successfully integrated multiple technologies such as Django, YOLO, OpenVino, and the OpenAI API to create a robust and efficient platform. We managed to maintain a balance between functionality and user privacy, providing valuable insights to improve productivity without being intrusive.

- What we learned
    - Throughout the development of Cascade Optimizer, we learned how to effectively integrate AI and computer vision technologies with a modern web framework. We also gained insights into optimizing backend performance while managing complex data models. Teamwork, File Structure and the importance of documentation and a clean, well-written code.

- What's next for Cascade Optimizer
    - The next step is to further refine the AI models to provide even more accurate productivity insights and to expand the platformâ€™s integration capabilities with other project management tools. The development of a mobile app and more TLC for the front end.

- **Tell us about your technology experience this weekend.**
    - During the hackathon, we worked with several tools, each with its strengths and challenges. OpenVino excelled in deploying our YOLO model for real-time object detection, though the setup was complex. GitHub was vital for version control and collaboration, seamlessly integrating with Visual Studio Code, which was our preferred IDE for its flexibility and live collaboration features. Python was our core language due to its vast libraries, although dependency management was occasionally tricky. PyCharm offered robust Python development tools but felt heavy compared to VSCode. Unfortunately, we faced issues with Softtek Frida as we couldn't establish a stable connection due to network restrictions, even when using mobile data, which was further hindered by the Tec Network blocking necessary ports. Improved network support would be beneficial for future events.
